P=NP Revisited

Description

After chessbot bugged PurpleCrayon for too long to share the proof for P=NP, PurpleCrayon decided to
leave the team! Now he has to find good and original problem ideas and flavor text...

However, it seems that most participants from the last contest found P=NP to be too easy, so chessbot
has buffed the problem to be harder!

Define F(x,y) as the total number of pairs n,p (0≤n≤x,0≤p≤y) such that p=n⋅p.

Chessbot wants you to find ∏_{i=1}^N ∏_{j=1}^P F(i,j) for a given N,P. Since this number may be very
large, please find it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The first line containers an integer T (1≤T≤10^4). Each of the next T lines contains two integers N,P
(1≤N,P≤3⋅10^5) corresponding product chessbot wants you to compute.

Output

Output T lines, one integer per line, denoting the desired product modulo 10^9+7.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
3               3
1 1             240
2 2             387366933
33 66

Sample Explanation

F(1,1)=3 for pairs (0,0),(1,0),(1,1).

So the answer for the first testcase is 3.

F(1,1)=3,F(2,1)=4,F(1,2)=4,F(2,2)=5. The product for those 4 numbers is 240 which is the answer.

Due to limited screen size, I cannot fully explain the third sample.

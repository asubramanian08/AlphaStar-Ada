Meeting Minutes

Description

The problem setting team tries to keep weekly meetings to discuss progress etc. Generally, the person
who arrives last has to do meeting minutes. Unfortunately, recently regardless of who arrives last,
Elijah does the meeting minutes (even if he does not show up to the meeting himself!).

You will be given a list of n, (1≤n≤100) names in the order that they arrived to the meeting. Each
person's name will be 20 characters or less.

You will have to output the person who will do the meeting minutes.

Input

The first line will contain an integer (1≤n≤100), the number of people who showed up to the meeting.
The following n lines will each contain one name per line, (1≤∣name∣≤20) denoting the name of the
person in the order they showed up to the meeting. All names will consist of only of ASCII characters.


Output

You will have to output the person who does the meeting minutes (Elijah!). The output is case
sensitive.

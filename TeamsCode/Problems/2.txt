Operations

Description

Bossologist is brushing up on his arithmetic skills, and has found an interesting way to practice by
doing P 1≤P≤10^5) problems of a certain format. For the pth problem, he first picks two numbers A_p
and B_p. He will then use the four operations +,−,∗,÷ to combine A_p and B_p in any way (i.e.
Bossologist finds A_p + B_p, A_p - B_p, B_p + A_p, etc.). For each of P problems determine the number
of distinct answers Bossologist gets.

Input

The first line of input will be P.

The next P lines will each contain the two numbers A_p and B_p (1≤A_p,B_p≤10^4) he picks for the pth
problem.

Output

Output P lines where the pth line gives the number of distinct answers Bossologist gets for problem p.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
4               6
2 19            6
3 5             6
4 3             4
6 6

Sample Explanation

For the first problem, the possible answers are 2+19=21, 2−19=−17, 19−2=17, 19⋅2=38, 19÷2=9.5, and
2÷19≈0.105, for a total of 6 distinct answers.

Changing Numbers

Description

Allie is given a list of n numbers, a_1, a_2, …, a_n. She is given m conditions, b_1, b_2, …, b_m,
denoting that the list should be modified to contain b_i occurrences of the number i. Allie can add or
subtract 1 from an element in the list, both operations having 1 cost. Help her find the minimum cost
needed to modify the list to satisfy the conditions.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n (1≤n≤10^5), and m (1≤n≤10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1≤a_i≤10^6).

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0≤b_i≤n).

It is guaranteed that ∑b_i = n.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum cost needed to modify the list to satisfy the conditions.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
5 3             2
2 2 1 2 2
2 2 1

Sample Explanation

One solution is to subtract 1 from the 1st element and add 1 to the 2nd element, with a total of 2
cost. The resulting sequence is 1 3 1 2 2, which contains 2 1's, 2 2's, and 1 3, satisfying all the
conditions. There is no way to fulfill the conditions with less cost, so the answer is 2.

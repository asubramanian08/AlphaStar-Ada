Late Midnight Assignment

Description

As a student of U.A., it's important for you to conduct villain threat analysis. So, your sadistic
teacher, Midnight, assigned you a painful homework assignment.

She gives you an N by M (1≤N≤500, 1≤M≤500) city A describing villains. The danger of the villain in
the ith row and jth column is given by A_ij≤10^9).

The threat level of k villains with danger d_1, d_2, …, d_k is d_1∣d_2∣⋯∣d_k, where ∣ is the
[bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) operator.

Your late (Mid)night assignment is to answer Q (1≤Q≤10^5) questions of the form X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2
(1≤X_1≤X_2≤N,1≤Y_1≤Y_2≤M). For each question, find the threat level of the villains in the rectangular
region of the city with top left corner at row X_1 and column Y_1 and bottom right corner at row X_2
​and column Y_2.

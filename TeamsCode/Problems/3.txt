Sticky Spelling Situation

Description

You are given two strings of equal length, A and B. Two strings are considered alike if they contain
the same count of each letter they possess. Note that two strings can be alike even if they are not
exactly equal. Your goal is to find the minimum number of letters that need to be changed in A in
order for the two strings to be considered alike.

Input

The first line of input will be an integer N (1≤N≤10^4), denoting the length of both of the strings.

Then the next two lines will contain two lowercase space-separated strings A and B.

Output

The output should be an integer representing the minimum number of letters needing to be changed in A
for the two strings to be considered alike.

Description

Megumin is a small adventurer going on an expedition! Her world has N+1 (N=2^k−1,0≤k≤30) cities
labeled from 0...N. There is a bidirectional road between every pair of cities. If Megumin wants to
travel from city i to city j, it takes her i⊕j⊕N days because she needs to explode the enemies on the
road. Here, ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator. Megumin starts at city A and wants to go to city B
(0≤A,B≤N).

For a path p, define explosion(p) to be the maximum of p_i⊕p_i+1⊕N over all roads p_i→p_i+1 on the
path. If there are no roads on p, explosion(p)=0. Find the minimum value of explosion(p) amongst all
paths p from city A to city B.

Input

The first line contains one integer, T (1≤T≤10^5), the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains 3 integers, N,A,B.

Output

For each test case, print the minimum value of explosion(p) amongst all paths p from city A to city B
on a separate line.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
3               0
0 0 0           0
1 0 1           0
3 1 2

Sample Explanation

In the first test case of the example, Megumin starts at her finish city, so she does not traverse any
roads. Hence the maximum is 0.

In the second test case of the example, Megumin can travel directly from city 0 to city 1. For p=0→1,
explosion(p)=max(0⊕1⊕1)=max(0)=0.

In the third test case of the example, Megumin can travel directly from city 1 to city 2. For p=1→2,
explosion(p)=max(1⊕2⊕3)=max(0)=0.

Note that Megumin could also take the path q=1→3→2. However, explosion(q)=max(1⊕3⊕3,3⊕2⊕3)=max(1,2)=2.
This is not the minimum for a path from city 1 to city 2 because explosion(p)=0≤2=explosion(q).

Shokugeki no Waifu

Description

You've just challenged Soma to a shokugeki (food war)! The winner gets to hold hands with their
favorite waifu!

In order to win, you need to craft the tastiest meal using N (1≤N≤10^5) ingredients. The umami of the
ith ingredient is U_i and the sweetness of the ith ingredient is S_i (1≤U_i,S_i≤10^9).

To make the tastiest meal, the ratio of umami and sweetness is important. More specifically, for each
ingredient, you need to make U_i=K⋅S_i (1≤K≤10^4). In one second, you can choose either the umami or
sweetness of a single ingredient and either increase or decrease it by 1.

Find the minimum amount of time you need to make the tastiest meal.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
2 5             2
5 1
9 3

Sample Explanation

For the 1st ingredient of the sample, you don't change the umami or sweetness. Now, U_1=5 and
K⋅S=5⋅1=5, so U_1=K⋅S_1. You spent 0 seconds changing the umami and sweetness of the 1st ingredient.

For the 2nd ingredient of the sample, you can spend a second increasing U_2 from 9 to 10. Then, you
can spend another second decreasing S_2 from 3 to 2. Now, U_2=10 and K⋅S_2=5⋅2=10, so U_2=K⋅S_2. You
spent 2 seconds changing the umami and sweetness of the 2nd ingredient.

In total, you spent 0+2=2 seconds making the tastiest meal, which is the minimum.

Oops, It's Yesterday Thrice More!

Description

In reference to a [similar problem](https://codeforces.com/gym/103470/problem/A), you have been tasked
with handling kangaroos on grids!

Misaka had an n by m grid of kangaroos. She also had a string s of instructions which were all L, R,
D, or U.

If the current instruction was L, a kangaroo on spot x,y would move to max(1,x−1),y

If the current instruction was R, a kangaroo on spot x,y would move to min(n,x+1),y

If the current instruction was D, a kangaroo on spot x,y would move to x,max(1,y−1)

If the current instruction was U, a kangaroo on spot x,y would move to x,min(m,y+1)

A given instruction will be followed by all kangaroos on the board. If two kangaroos end up on the
same spot, they will move together for all of the following instructions.

Initially there is a kangaroo on every cell x,y such that (1≤x≤n),(1≤y≤m). After the instruction
string s was executed, every kangaroo was gathered on the same cell.

Unfortunately, Misaka has forgotten the original size of the grid n and m! Luckily, she still
remembers the instruction string s and would like you to find the maximum area of the original grid.

Input

The first line will be one integer T denoting the number of testcases (1≤T≤100). Each of the following
T lines will contain an integer n denoting the length of the instruction string followed by a string s
denoted the instruction string (1≤n≤10^6). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases is
less than 10^6.

Output

You will output lines. Each line will contain one integer denoting the maximum area of a grid that
guarantees after the instruction string s is executed all the kangaroos are on the same spot.

Sample Explanation

In the first sample, the kangaroos on (1, 1) will all move to (1, 2) on a 1x2 board. It can be proven
no better area exists.

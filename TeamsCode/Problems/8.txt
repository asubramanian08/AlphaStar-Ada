Water Ziplines

Description

There is an ocean in a cartesian plane ranging from (0,0) to (M,N). On some of the integer coordinates
of this cartesian plane there are islands. All the islands are owned by either Alex, Bossologist, or
Codicon. Alex wants to build as many different ziplines from any of his islands to any of
Bossologist's islands as possible. Here are the conditions for making a zipline:

1. A zipline must be a straight line, starting from one of Alex's islands and ending at one of
Bossologist's islands.
2. It must not cross any of Codicon's islands.
3. A zipline can pass through any of Alex or Bossologist's other islands.

A zipline is considered different from another if either the starting point or the ending point is
different.

Input

There will be two space-separated integers 1≤M≤120 and 1≤N≤120. The cartesian plane will range from
(0,0) to (M,N). Thus, there will be M+1 lines of N+1 space-separated characters, which will be either
A, B, C, or W. A represents Alex-owned islands, B represents Bossologist-owned islands, C represents
Codicon-owned islands, and W represents the water (ocean).

Output

The output will be an integer showing the number of different ziplines that can be created satisfying
the conditions.

A A A
C C W
B B B

Sample Explanation

There are 5 different ziplines. For the first A island located at (0,0), there is one B island it can
reach, (2,1). For the second A island located at (0,1), there are two B islands, (2,0) and (2,2). For
the final A island located at (0,2), there are also two ziplines that can reach an island B, (2,1) and
(2,2). Thus the answer is 1+2+2=5.

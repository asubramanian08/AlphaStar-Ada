PROBLEM:

Construct a Numeral Triangle according to the following rules. You will be given
three positive integers: s, a starting number; d, a delta (the amount by which to increase each
number in the triangle); and r the number of rows.

The first row contains the number s.
Each of the next rows has one more number than the previous row.
Each number in the triangle is d more than the previous number in the triangle.
Before putting a number in the triangle, it is transformed to a single digit. That is, if the number
is more than one digit, replace it by the sum of the digits, repeating until the sum is one digit
(for example, 1938 ⇒ 21 ⇒ 3).
Here are two examples of Numeral Triangles:

start=2, delta=3, rows=5
2
5 8
2 5 8
2 5 8 2
5 8 2 5 8

start=221, delta=2, rows=4 
5
7 9
2 4 6
8 1 3 5

INPUT:

There are 5 lines of data. Each line has 3 positive integers, s, d, and r. The numbers are separated
by spaces and each is less than 100,000.

OUTPUT:​

For each line of data, print the sum of all numbers on the r th line of the Numeral Triangle.

MODE: normal
For example:

Input	    Result
2 3 5       28
221 2 4     17
184 231 35  140
71 5 27     135
1 24 100    397

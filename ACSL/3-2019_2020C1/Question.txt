PROBLEM:

Given a positive integer (call it N), a position in that integer (call it P), and a transition
integer (call it D). Transform N as follows:

If the Pth digit of N from the right is from 0 to 4, add D to it. Replace the Pth digit by the units
digit of the sum. Then, replace all digits to the right of the Pth digit by 0.
If the Pth digit of N from the right is from 5 to 9, subtract D from it. Replace the Pth digit by the
leftmost digit of the absolute value of the difference. Then, replace all digits to the right of the
Pth digit by 0.
Example 1: N = 7145032, P = 2, D = 8 . The 2nd digit from the right is 3; add 8 to it (3+8=11), and
replace the 3 with 1 to get 7145012. Replace the digits to the right by 0s to get 7145010.

Example 2: N = 1540670, P = 3, D = 54. The 3rd digit from the right is 6; the absolute value of 6-54
is 48; replace with the 4 to get 1540470. Replace the digits to the right with 0s to get 1540400.

INPUT: There will be 5 sets of data. Each set contains 3 positive integers: N, P, and D. N will be
less than 1015; P and D will be valid inputs. No input will cause an output to have a leading digit
of 0.

OUTPUT: Print the transformed number. The printed number may not have any spaces between the digits.

MODE: normal
For example:

124987 2 523    124950

Question:
    How many decimal numbers from 1 to 32 have the same number of 1’s and 0’s in their binary
    representation?
    Note: ignore leading zeroes.
Solution:
    110 = 12 and 3210 = 1000002
    Number of digits in the binary number:   1    2    3    4    5
    Number with same number of 1’s as 0’s:   0    1    0    3    0
    Total is 4.
    The correct answer is: 4

What Does This Program Do? - Branching
Question:
    What is output when this program is executed?
    a = 2 : b = 1 : c = 0 : d = 3 : e = 4
    f = a + b + c + d + e
    if f / 5 == a then
        f = f / 5
    else
        f = a + 2
    end if
    if a + b < d * e / 2 then
        b = d
    else
        a = e
    end if
    if 2 * d ↑ c == e / a then
        d = e
    else
        c = a
    end if
    if (b < d) && (c < e) then
        b = d
    else
        c = e
    end if
    if (c ↑ a > d * e) || (f < d / e) then
        c = a
    else
        d = c
    end if
    output 2 * a + b * (c − d) + e / 2 * f
    end
Solution:
    _Look at Figure5.png_
    2 * a + b * (c - d) + e / 2 * f = 2 * 2 + 4 * (0 - 0) + 4 / 2 * 2
        = 2 * 2 + 4 * 0 + 4 / 2 * 2
        = 4 + 0 + 4
        = 8
    The correct answer is: 8

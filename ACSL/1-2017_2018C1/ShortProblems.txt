Question:
    How many 1’s are there in the binary representations of: 16743_8
Solution:
    16743_8 = 001 110 111 100 0112
    So there are 9 1’s.
    The correct answer is: 9

Computer Number Systems:
Question: Convert 3F6A_16 to octal.
Solution:
    3F6A_16 = 0011 1111 0110 1010_2
            = 0 011 111 101 101 010_2
            =     3   7   5   5   2_8
    The correct answer is: 37552

Question:
    _Look at Figure1.png_
        Begin with a rhombus. This is Stage 1 and there is one rhombus with 4 segments in its
    perimeter. The next stage adds a congruent rhombus on each perimeter edge of the previous figure.
    Now there are five congruent rhombuses and 12 segments in its perimeter. The third stage adds 8
    more for a total of 13 and 20 segments in its perimeter. Each subsequent stage is formed in the
    same manner. How many segments are its perimeter after Stage 6 is completed?
Solution:
        Stage 1 has 1 rhombus and 4 segments. Stage 2 has 5 rhombuses and 12 segments since 4 were
    drawn on the original sides.  In Stage 3 there are 12 perimeter segments but because 8 are used
    in more than 1 rhombus, there are only 8 new rhombuses drawn for a total of 13 and 20 segments.
    Continuing in this manner, Stage 4 has 12 new rhombuses for a total of 25 and 28 segments. Stage
    5 adds 16 for a total of 41 and has 36 segments and Stage 6 adds 20 for a total of 61 and 44
    segments.
    The sequence is 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44 …
    The correct answer is: 44

Recursive Functions:
Question:
    Find 𝑓(12) given:
    _Look at Figure2.png_
Solution:
    𝑓(12)=𝑓(10)−3=11
    𝑓(10)=𝑓(8)−3=14
    𝑓(8)=𝑓(6)+4=17
    𝑓(6)=𝑓(2)+4=13
    𝑓(2)=9 Now substitute backwards.
    The correct answer is: 11

What Does This Program Do?
Question:
    What is outputted when this program is run?
    a = 12: b = 1: c = 0: d = 4 : e = 2
    if  a > d then a = a - d
    if (d – b) < (e – a) then d = d + e
    if a * b == d * e then e = a * b / e else d = d * e / a
    if d ↑ 2 < = (b + 1) ↑ 2 then d = b + 1 else b = b + 1
    if a + b * c == d + e * c then a = b * c else d = e * c
    output (a + e) / b + (d + c) ↑ b * c
Solution:
    The table contains the values of a, b, c, d, and e after each line.
    _Look at Figure3.png_
    (a + e) / b + (d + c) ↑ b * c = (8 + 4) / 2 + (0 + 0) ↑ 2 * 0 = 12 / 2 + 02 * 0 = 6 + 0 = 6
    The correct answer is: 6

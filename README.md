## AlphaStar-Ada

### About

I took the [AlphaStar Ada master courses](https://alphastar.academy/cs-master-courses/#masterschedule) (CC39-21) with [Dr. Fatih Gelgi](https://alphastar.academy/people/fgelgi/). Starting on September 19th the classes meet almost every other week for 2 hours. Each class we discuss (and implement for homework) a few problems from from a variety of contests (see [organization](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada#organization)).

### Organization

**Week organized folders**: Each week of the AlphaStar-Ada course has its own folder (named "Week #") containing that week's homework problem, the Lecture.pdf, and _possibly_ some notes. Each homework problem is named "(problem#)-(contestDescription)". There are 3 contests involved with this course:
1. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/): "CF(contest#)(problemLetter)". Check out my [Codeforces repos](https://github.com/asubramanian08/Codeforces) and for more information on my involvement in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) see my [Codeforces README](https://github.com/asubramanian08/Codeforces#readme).
2. [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/): "ACSL(yearStart2)_(yearEnd2)C(contest#)" for example ACSL17_18C1. Check out my [ACSL folder](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada/tree/master/ACSL) and for more information on my involvement in [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) see my [ACSL section](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada#acsl) of the [AlphaStar-Ada README](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada#readme).
3. [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/): "DMOJ-(contestDescription)" for example 4-DMOJ-coci19c1p1. The contestDescription is determined by what ever the last part problem link is: "https://dmoj.ca/problem/(contestDescription)". My involvement in [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) is minimal and limited to this course.
4. [USACO](http://usaco.org): "USACO-(division)-(month)(year)q(question#)". Look at my [USACO repos](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) for all the work I have done in [USACO](https://usaco.org). In this class I have done a few practice [USACO](https://usaco.org) problems, but nothing much beyond that. To see how I trained for [USACO](https://usaco.org) and more; check you my [USACO README](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO#readme).
5. [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam): "CJ(round)(year)Q(problem)". Similar to [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) my involvement with Code Jam is limited to this class. I have only done a handful of questions from this website. I have no repos for question I have done with [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam). In order to submit questions I created an account, my username is Magmamite125.

### ACSL

The [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) competition was introduce to me by this course. It is a computer science competition consisting of 2 sections. The first short problems section is, as the name implies, a few short problems that must be solved in a certain time frame (30 mins I believe). The second sections contains a programming problem (requiring code) the must be submitting in a 3 day span. I join the AlphaStar [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) team, so in addition to the homework problems I do [practice ACSL contests](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-Ada/tree/master/ACSL) (and of course the real contests too).

[ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) is divided by practice exam (in chronological order) named "P(exam#)-(yearStart)_(yearEnd)C(contest#)". Official tests for [AlphaStar](https://alphastar.academy/) be marked as such with a file named Official.txt and will start with an "O" instead of a "P". It will the followed by startYear _ endYear then the contest number. Each exam folder contains:
* ShortProblems.txt _private_: Containing a list of the [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) short problem questions and solutions (answer + explanation). This might possibly require images named "Figure(#).png". It will be noted where the figure should be 'inserted'.
* Question.txt _private_: The singular programming question in the [ACSL](https://www.acsl.org/) contests.
* Answer: My answer to the programming question from Question.txt.
* _possibly_ Official.txt: This files notes that the contest was officially taken. The file will contain the scores to both my short questions and programming question and any other related information. Everyone's scores can be seen on the [ACSL leader-board](https://www.scores.acsl.org/leaderboard/students/j5/).
